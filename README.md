## Frontend Experiments

This is my coding playground where I experiment with different web development tools! 

**What's inside?**

* **Static Websites:** Cool websites built with HTML and CSS. Think colorful layouts and fun animations!
* **JavaScript Challenges:** Code puzzles to test my brain and improve my JavaScript skills. 
* **Angular Adventures:** (New!) Trying out Angular to build more interactive web apps. 

**Folders:**

* **HTML:** Holds all the code for my static websites.
* **CSS:** Stores the styles that make my websites look awesome!
* **JavaScript:** Contains my problem-solving code and any non-Angular JavaScript functionalities.
* **Angular:** (New!) This folder will house my future Angular projects, with separate sections for different parts of the app.
